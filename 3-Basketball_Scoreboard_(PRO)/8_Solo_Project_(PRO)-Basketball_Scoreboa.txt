Hints for this project
https://projects.scrimba.com/basketball-scoreboard

Basic Requirements
-	Build it from scratch*
	*Or use the basic framework provided by Scrimba.
	You can build in Scrimba or use your local computer.
-	Follow the design.
	Use the Figma file above as reference.
-	Make all six buttons work.
	Three buttons (+1, +2, +3) for the home team.
	Three buttons (+1, +2, +3) for the guest team.
	Each button add the stated point to one of the teams when clicked.

Stretch Goals (PS: Only if you want to go above and beyond)
These goals require concepts that have not taught before.
Hence, the stretch goals are for students who are ahead of the class
or find the basic requirements boring.
Don't do these goals if you are struggling.

-	Add a "New Game" button.
	This button resets the scores and starts a new game.
-	Highlight the leader.
	A display that shows which team has the highest current score.
-	Add a few more counters (e.g. period, fouls, timer).
	This is considered really complex,
	and far beyond what has been taught in JavaScript class so far.
-	Change the design
	You can even change the sports and
	buttons to accommodate the new sport.
