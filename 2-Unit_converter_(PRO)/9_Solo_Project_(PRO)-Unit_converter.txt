The unit converter converts numbers between metric and imperial units.
It converts Lengths (Meters/Feet), Volumes (Liters/Gallons) and Mass (Kilograms/Pounds)

Requirements
1.	Follow one of the design specs (light mode or dark mode) as shown in the downloaded Figma file.
2.	Generate all conversions when the user clicks "Convert".
	All fields (meters, feet, liters, gallons, kilograms and pounds) must be populated with their respective values.
3.	Round the numbers down to three (3) decimal places.
	JavaScript tends to include many decimal places when it's doing calculations.
	You have trim the decimal places down to 3 to make the numbers more readable.

PS: Please remember that we have both a #javascript-help channel and a #html-css-help channel in our Discord community.
If you have a very specific issue youâ€™re struggling with, you should consider posting it there.

JavaScript hint
If you are struggling with getting started with the JavaScript,
please take a look at this scrim (https://scrimba.com/scrim/co8e04296aac8b82727334c00),
which contains the code for fetching the user input and converting it from meter to feet.


CSS hint
If you are struggling with getting started with the CSS,
please take a look at this scrim (https://scrimba.com/scrim/co1f140ca9b50117cf9bd740a),
which contains  a little bit of styling for the header and the main section.




If you are still struggling for hours with this Solo Project after having used both of the above hints,
please let the teacher Per Harald Borgen know via the #general channel on Discord,
and we will consider adding more hints.
Important: be sure to include a link to your scrim,
so that he can understand what you are struggling with.
